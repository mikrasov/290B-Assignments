<h3>Analysis</h3>
<h4>What do you see as the advantages/disadvantages of your task scheduler?</h4>
<p>
The main advantage of our task scheduler is that it is simple and it works. It goes through and in
order looks through the tasks that were waiting inputs, and if they are ready to execute, it executes them.
This approach works because the size of the tasks are pretty evenly divided, and the execution environments are
typically similar in nature, so computers finish at roughly the same time
</p>
<p>A better version of the scheduler would account for discrepancy in task size and processing ability of computers
and make sure that computers were always busy (through strategies like work stealing that we discussed in class). 
Our scheduler also does not prioritized joining tasks over forking tasks, so the number of tasks currently on the queue
can balloon out (especially for Fibonacci). </p>
<h4>How might you change the infrastructure to improve your parallel efficiency?</h4>
<p>
Currently the computers receive only one task at a time. This causes the computers to wait for the slower network
traffic between each task. Pre-fetching tasks while a computer is running can reduce this network delay. This is
what we will do in HW4. For Fibonacci there is a lot of redundant work as lower Fibonacci numbers are calculated
over and over again. Having a cache (perhaps at multiple levels) of results based on a series of inputs would
drastically reduce the number of task executions needed for problems like Fibonacci. TSP would would not benefit
from this change.
</p>
<h4>What issues are involved in generalizing your infrastructure to a network of Spaces?</h4>
<p>It would be easy enough to scale our implementation to a network of spaces. Each space would implement
computer methods. Each space would then be able to do computation itself and/or delegate computation to
other spaces/computers.</p>
<p> The main change that will be needed is to move the space from single task produces a single result to being
able to process multiple parallel tasks. The space would also need to do computation itself (currently it delegates all
tasks out to computers). If it was a terminal node in the network it would want to do solely computation but if it was an
internal node in the network it would need to strike a balance between computation and delegation.</p>
