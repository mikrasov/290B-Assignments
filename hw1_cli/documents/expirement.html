<p>
The execution time was low as we optimized the distance computation by precomputing
all distance pairs as a triangular matrix which we checked against for each run.
This was the second pass at our implementation, our first was more nieve and ran on the order of 15 seconds.

<p>
Our time was pretty standard as we had a direct to specification of the Mandelbrot set
algorithm.
