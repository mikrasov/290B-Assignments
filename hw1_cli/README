I created the directory hw1_cli so that we have a place separate from the netbeans project to compile with ant. This is also the directory that we will be turning in.



To execute:


cd hw1_cli


ant dist


ant runComputer

*and in separate terminal window*:

ant runMandelbrotClient


ant runTSPClient
