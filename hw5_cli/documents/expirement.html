<h3>Experiment Analysis</h3>
While running TSP on one computer takes about 90 seconds, we can see that adding 3 more computers divides the time by 4.
The paralle efficiency for 4 computers is ~1 at %93. Adding 12 more computers (c = 16) we see the time drop to 18 seconds. For
16 cities, this is quite fast! The parallel efficiency plot shows that that PE is %120 for c = 16 - therefore it looks like using
that many computers actually paid off.

We can see that Tinf is significantly less than T1. This makes sense, since Tinf is just the time of the critical path.
