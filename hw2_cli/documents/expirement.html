<h3>Analysis</h3>

1.Explain the differences in job execution times.<br>
Same jvm vs. different jvm: were still starting up separate threads so the time wont be different.<p>
Different machines - even if faster, tcp overhead still makes the time the same<p>
No real difference between c = 1 and c = 2, perhaps with c = 4 we would see a difference<p>
2.To improve your understanding of what is going on, what other measurements would you like to see included?<br>
One measurement that would be important to factor into our results is TCP overhead time, "How long did it take to send an actual task over the wire to a computer?".
3.Enumerate what you believe to be the key points concerning thread safety.<br>
talk about: <br>
- BlockingQueue? <br>
- Dispatcher? <br>
